Wecome!

Infrared Birds is a project. It is a side-project. A summer project.

We want to explore poetry and machine learning. We want to write poems, read poems, and we want to find a way to have a program do the same.

Has this been done? Sure. So, what can we contribute? Our minds. A good portion of the language analysis available consists of works by classic poets, but what if the base were an amateur or a hobbyist? Writers spend an incredible amount of time working on reordering ideas, restructuring phrases. Would come computer generated lines in their own style help them take the next steps of completing a project more easily? That's one problem we would like to tackle, but like writing, this project is likely to take on a life of its own.

So sit back, read, and enjoy the ride.
